Idea: The UAKey, to give you(U) A(A) grade encryption and protection in the form of a physical key(Key).
Not (wink wink wink) intended to be a pun or a one-up of the popular yubikey.

The UAKey is a device that connects to your PC or Laptop through USB and inputs encrypted passwords from the UAKey into password fields. 
Having your passwords encrypted on a personal item can help you keep your passwords off the web and safe from hackers.
More marketing sleeze and slag to really sell this thing.
KeePassXC has browser integration, password input, storage, and encryption that we can use
Expands upon the KeePassXC repository by allowing for the UAKey to store passwords in the UAKey
