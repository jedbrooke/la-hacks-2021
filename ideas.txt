Idea: The UAKey, to give you(U) A(A) grade encryption and protection in the form of a physical key(Key).
Not (wink wink wink) intended to be a pun or a one-up of the popular yubikey.

The UAKey is a device that connects to your PC or Laptop through USB and inputs encrypted passwords from the UAKey into password fields. 
Having your passwords encrypted on a personal item can help you keep your passwords off the web and safe from hackers.
More marketing sleeze and slag to really sell this thing.

Base Functionality:
Offline device stores passwords encrypted in flash. When plugged in, prompts for master password. Descrypts passwords, 
and when prompted, types the password as if the device were a keyboard.

Fall back option:
KeePassXC has browser integration, password input, storage, and encryption that we can use
Expands upon the KeePassXC repository by allowing for the UAKey to store passwords in the UAKey
